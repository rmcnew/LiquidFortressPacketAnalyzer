/**
 * SystemErrEater
 * <p/>
 * Pcap4j is wonderful, but it uses SLF4J as its logging framework.  This
 * causes a "no configuration" error message to be printed to stderr when
 * Pcap4j is loaded.  This class eats the System.err stream so that the
 * error message is not shown.  This is probably not the best approach to
 * solve this problem, but this project needs to be completed ;)
